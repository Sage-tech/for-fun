      I am a iOS Developer looking for my first team to help build apps. Ive learned iOS Development from both an iOS Bootcamp and from a software engineer in the industry. I have been in retail for over 5+ years mainly as a store manager and now I'm ready to make a different contribution as a software developer. As an iOS developer a great achievement of mine so far is completing two apps and launching them both on the App Store, Currently working on a new Digital board game in SpriteKit while I look for role in iOS.
